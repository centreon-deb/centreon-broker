Description: monitoring addon fully compatible with Nagios and Centreon
 Centreon Broker offers an effective new way to store your monitoring
 results provided by Centreon Engine in a central and structured
 database. With its flexible core engine, you can now decide exactly how
 your data will streamed over the network. These transfers are also
 extremely fast and optimized.
 .
 If required, you will be able to set up an auxiliary database dedicated to
 monitoring only a part of your IT infrastructure.
 .
 By setting up such fail-overs that are activated when the primary database
 is down, you will better guarantee no data loss for your Centreon users.
